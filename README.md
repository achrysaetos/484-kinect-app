# 484 - Scratch Off App
Our project is an art sharing system that allows students to choose a category of pictures from which they want to scratch off and reveal. After uncovering the image, students are also be able to submit their own photos so that others have the chance to see images they want to share! 

Our tasks that the installation address are to provide a short break for student in order to destress (creative component) and allow students to share and view community creations (collaborative component). Users can complete the full experience in a reasonable time frame (ie. 2 mins), giving them a refreshing break.
* Creative component - added two types of art (ai vs human) that users can compare and explore
* Collaborative component - added a QR code so users can submit pictures together and share their interests

## Dependencies to run the project
None! Just open `index.html`.

## Constraints from deployment environment
This project is a single player game and is easiest to use if you are roughly 5 feet away from the screen. Any spectators should be further from the screen, as the tracking can be less accurate if there are multiple users at the same depth from the kinect.

## Collaboration Record
Ez Belay (eb898): Helped come up with the idea to pivot to a scratch off art sharing project, created the Landing/home page and navigation to the themes page (index.html, landing.js), prototyping for the button navigation between pages, testing project on TV screen

Ryan Tsai (rat29): Brainstormed ideas with group; developed pages and functions for the prototype (navigation, tracker, theme selection page); general debugging and testing; cooperative with group meetings and communication

Natasha Ravinand (nr436): Brainstormed ideas to pivot from Canvas app to scratch-off app; developed the high-fidelity prototype in Figma along with color palette, clip images from group to use; created the navigation bar functionality (navbarSelect.js) and QR code/page (QR code itself, Google Drive, and qr_page.html)

Leck Tang (clt38): Created the scratchoff canvas, helped choose pictures and categories, added quality of life changes (tracking for left/right hands, handling groups of users), fixed a lot of bugs
