# 484 - Scratch Off App
Our project is an art sharing system that allows students to choose a category of pictures from which they want to scratch off and reveal. After uncovering the image, students are also be able to submit their own photos so that others have the chance to see images they want to share! 

Our tasks that the installation addresses are to provide a short break for student in order to destress (creative component) and allow students to share and view community creations (collaborative component).

## Dependencies to Run the Project
